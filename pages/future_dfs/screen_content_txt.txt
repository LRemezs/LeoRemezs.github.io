While currently my main goal is to learn Front End Engineer career path, it is definitely not the final destination. Once I am done with this course, I will continue with Back End technologies. I am definitely looking forward to work and gather experience as a Web Developer for a while, however, I will surely take time to explore other aspects of coding such as Machine Learning, Automation and ideas behind AI.
